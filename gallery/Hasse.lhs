A subset is represented by the size of the parent set paired with the
list of elements in the subset.  `isSubset` tests whether one set is a
subset of another; `subsetsBySize` lists all the subsets of a set of
size `n`, grouped according to size.

> data Subset = Subset Int [Int]
>
> (Subset _ elts1) `isSubset` (Subset _ elts2) = all (`elem` elts2) elts1
>
> subsetsBySize :: Int -> [[Subset]]
> subsetsBySize n = map (map (Subset n))

Draw the elements of a subset, by drawing a colored square for each
element present, and leaving a blank space for absent elements.

> drawElts n elts = hcat
>                 . map (\i -> if i `elem` elts
>                                then drawElt i
>                                else strutX 1
>                       )
>                 $ [1..n]
>
> drawElt e = unitSquare # fc (colors !! e) # lw thin

Draw a subset by drawing a dashed rectangle around the elements.  Note
that we also assign a name to the rectangle, corresponding to the
elements it contains, which we use to draw connections between subsets
later.

> drawSet (Subset n elts) = (    drawElts n elts # centerXY
>                             <> rect (fromIntegral n + 0.5) 1.5
>                                  # dashingG [0.2,0.2] 0
>                                  # lw thin
>                                  # named elts
>                           )

Draw a Hasse diagram by drawing subsets grouped by size in rows, and
connecting each set to its subsets in the row below.  [See the user
manual](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/manual/diagrams-manual.html#named-subdiagrams)
for a more in-depth explanation of how names are used to connect subsets.

> hasseRow = centerX . hcat' (with & sep .~ 2) . map drawSet
>
> hasseDiagram n = setsD # drawConnections # centerXY
>   where setsD = vcat' (with & sep .~ fromIntegral n)
>               . map hasseRow
>               . reverse
>               $ subsets
>         subsets = subsetsBySize n
>         drawConnections = applyAll connections

To generate all the connections, we apply `connectSome` to each pair
of adjacent rows, which calls `connect` on those pairs where one is a
subset of the other.

>         connections = concat $ zipWith connectSome subsets (tail subsets)
>         connectSome subs1 subs2 = [ connect s1 s2 | s1 <- subs1
>                                                   , s2 <- subs2
>                                                   , s1 `isSubset` s2 ]

Connect two subsets by looking up the subdiagrams named with their
elements, and drawing a line from the upper boundary of one to the
lower boundary of the other.

>         connect (Subset _ elts1) (Subset _ elts2) =
>           withNames [elts1, elts2] $ \[b1, b2] ->
>             beneath ((boundaryFrom b1 unitY ~~ boundaryFrom b2 unit_Y) # lw thin)

> example = pad 1.1 $ hasseDiagram 4
